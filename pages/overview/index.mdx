# Why Rhinestone?

A brief preamble on why we are building Rhinestone:

## The problem

Today there are significant barriers to the development of products that utilize smart accounts: **developer complexity**, **security**, and **a lack of simple feature customization**, leading to **vendor lock-in** and **ecosystem fragmentation**.

These challenges paint a picture of a homogenous smart account ecosystem where building novel features is costly, expensive audits disincentivize experimentation, and high switching costs increase user adoption risk.

We envision a world where smart accounts are simple (from a DevEx perspective), extensible, portable, and secure. Our unique modular smart account infrastructure and tooling achieve this. We transform the smart account into an open platform where any third-party developer can develop self-contained features (in the form of modules) that can be installed and used by any application developer or user.

## Who uses Rhinestone?

Developers use Rhinestone to build modules that power unique onchain products or services. Our tooling streamlines the development process and our infrastructure provides a secure distribution mechanism with existing smart account implementations.

We partner with account vendors (such as Safe, Biconomy, and ZeroDev) and smart account wallet vendors to extend their feature set via a marketplace of third-party modules.

## The module developer opportunity

Modular smart accounts are a paradigm shift in onchain product development and distribution.

- **Rhinestone Wallet**: A reference implementation of a direct-to-consumer “app store” powered by smart account modules
- **The Module Store**: The first plug-and-play wallet platform built on top of a modular smart account
