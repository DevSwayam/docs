# Rhinestone Infrastructure

Today, smart accounts are still plagued by many issues: developer complexity, cross-chain smart contract sync, vendor lock-in, ecosystem fragmentation, and a lack of customization. Rhinestoneâ€™s Infrastructure aims to solve these challenges, transforming smart accounts into the next compostable platform for open innovation.

## Challenges Rhinestone Infrastructure Solves

### Smart Account Security

Smart accounts introduce smart contract risk for users. Allowing any developer to build a module that can extend the functionality of smart accounts significantly increases a user's attack surface. Without new security frameworks, the potential of what modular smart accounts can unlock for users and developers will be severely limited.

### Fragmentation

Since the finalized audit of the ERC-4337 entrypoint contract, a flurry of new smart accounts has emerged. This has led to a fragmentation of the ecosystem, with tooling and application developers having to choose which implementation to prioritize. We lead the work around ERC-7579 to combat this, but we still see significant scope outside of standards to promote greater smart account interoperability.

### Vendor Lock-in

A direct symptom of fragmentation is vendor lock-in. As developer tooling becomes more opinionated toward certain account implementations, application developers and users can be locked into a local optimum that limits innovation and reduces competition. Unlike EOAs, users can suffer from an inability to seamlessly move between clients offering similar but competing services.

### Monetization

For a vibrant ecosystem of applications to emerge on top of smart accounts, developers require sustainable economics, and the stakeholders involved in making this ecosystem possible need to be fairly rewarded.

### Omnichain Smart Accounts

Unlike EOAs, smart accounts are not easily portable across L2s. State sync is a problem, and lack of bytecode equivalence can lead to different addresses for different chains. With the emergence of modular smart accounts, account and module config introduces a new layer of complexity for users and developers.

## Solutions

### The Module Registry

Installing third-party modules unchecked opens up a wide range of attack vectors. As such, an open module marketplace requires a credibly neutral, permissionless, and highly scalable system for solving this problem. The Module Registry provides this solution. It stores security attestations on modules and allows smart accounts to query them when installing or executing a module.

### ERC-7579 and Account Adapters

We led the development of [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com), a minimal standard for modular smart accounts, to create greater interoperability of modules across the various smart account implementations. ERC-7579 is now the leading standard for modular accounts, significantly reducing vendor lock-in and ensuring any developer building with Rhinestone can service the growing market of smart accounts and wallets.

For accounts that are not yet compliant with ERC-7579, we are developing account adapters to act as a translation layer between ERC-7579 modules and non-compliant accounts. An example is the [Safe7579 Adapter](/safe7579), co-developed with Safe and allowing a Safe developer to access modules from the Rhinestone ecosystem.
