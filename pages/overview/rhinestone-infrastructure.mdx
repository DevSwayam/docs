# Rhinestone Infrastructure

Today, smart accounts are still plagued by many issues: developer complexity, cross-chain smart contract sync, vendor lock-in, ecosystem fragmentation, and a lack of customization. Rhinestoneâ€™s Infrastructure aims to solve these challenges, transforming smart accounts into the next compostable platform for open innovation.

## Overview of Rhinestone Infrastructure components

### The Module Registry

Smart accounts introduce smart contract risk for users. Allowing any developer to build a module that can extend the functionality of smart accounts significantly increases a user's attack surface. Without new security frameworks, the potential of what modular smart accounts can unlock for users and developers will be severely limited.

An open module marketplace requires a credibly neutral, permissionless, and highly scalable system for solving this problem. The Module Registry provides this solution. It stores security attestations on modules and allows smart accounts to query them when installing and using modules.

### ERC-7579 and Account Adapters

Since the finalized audit of the ERC-4337 entrypoint contract, a flurry of new smart accounts has emerged. This has led to a fragmentation of the ecosystem, with tooling and application developers having to choose which implementation to prioritize. To combat this, we lead the work around [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com), a minimal standard for modular smart accounts. ERC-7579 is now the leading standard for modular accounts, significantly reducing vendor lock-in and ensuring any developer building with Rhinestone can service the growing market of smart accounts and wallets.

For accounts that are not yet compliant with ERC-7579, we are developing account adapters to act as a translation layer between ERC-7579 modules and non-compliant accounts. An example is the [Safe7579 Adapter](/safe7579), co-developed with Safe and allowing a Safe developer to access modules from the Rhinestone ecosystem.

### Rhinestone Automations

Modular smart accounts allow users to delegate permissions to third-party services to perform onchain actions on their behalf. This is a game changer for developers building trust-minimized automated systems for users. Rhinestone has developed out-of-the-box components to make building account automations a breeze.

Rhinestone Automations is a relay service that allows developers to construct event triggers that, when fired, lead to pre-determined logic executed on the user's account. The service integrates with session keys, executor modules, and ERC-4337 transaction infrastructure to bring about account automations in a simple and trust-minimized manner for developers.

### Rhinestone Payments

For a vibrant ecosystem of applications to emerge on top of smart accounts, developers require sustainable economics, and the stakeholders involved in making this ecosystem possible need to be fairly rewarded. We're developing a "module fee system" that will make it 10x easier for projects to monetize their work when building with modular smart accounts.

The objective of this system is to provide credibly neutral payment rails that can foster a positive-sum game and easily scale. It will remove the need for module or application developers to build and maintain an independent payment system while retaining flexibility and without creating heavy reliance on a third party.

Coming soon.

### Omnichain Smart Accounts

Unlike EOAs, smart accounts are not easily portable across L2s. State sync is a problem, and lack of bytecode equivalence can lead to different addresses for different chains. With the emergence of modular smart accounts, account and module config introduces a new layer of complexity for users and developers.

We're developing a system of modules and tools to make it easy for developers to manage and create an omnichain experience for their users.

Coming soon.
