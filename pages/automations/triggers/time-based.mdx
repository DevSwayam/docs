# How to use the time-based trigger

The time-based trigger is a trigger that is executed at a specific time or at a specific interval. This trigger is useful when you want to automate a specific action on a schedule, such as once every week.

<Steps>

### Create the automations client

First, create an instance of the `Automations` client:

```typescript
import { createAutomationClient } from '@rhinestone/automations-sdk'

const automationClient = createAutomationClient({
  account: '0x...',
  accountType: 'SAFE', // 'SAFE', 'KERNEL',
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  accountInitCode: '0x',
  network: 11155111,
  validator: '0x...',
})
```

### Create the automation details

Next, create the automation details:

```typescript
const actions = [
  {
    type: 'static',
    target: '0x503b54Ed1E62365F0c9e4caF1479623b08acbe77',
    value: 100,
    callData: '0x',
  },
]

const maxNumberOfExecutions = 10
```

Here, the actions are an array of actions to make on behalf of the account. They can either be static, in which case all the calldata is pre-defined, or dynamic, in which case the calldata is generated by a call to a calldata builder service. The `maxNumberOfExecutions` is the number of times the automation will be executed.

### Create the time based trigger details

Next, create the time based trigger details:

```typescript
const triggerData = {
  cronExpression: '*/60 * * * * *',
  startDate: new Date().getTime(),
}
```

Here, the `cronExpression` is a cron expression that defines the schedule for the automation. The `startDate` is the start date for the automation.

### Create the automation

Finally, create the automation:

```typescript
const automation = await automationClient.createAutomation({
  type: 'time-based',
  data: {
    trigger: {
      triggerData,
    },
    actions,
    maxNumberOfExecutions,
  },
})
```

</Steps>
