# Security

Smart accounts not only unlock many novel product features, but also allow for the creation of a much more secure account. Wallets can use these security-centered modules to give their users extra protection.

## Social Recovery

This allows users to specify one or multiple guardians with an m or n threshold for account recovery. The user sets a guardian by expressing the public address of the guardian.                                                

## Registry Hook

## Deadman Switch

Recover an account after a specified inactive period. The user sets the target recovery address (this could be another smart account or a typical EOA wallet) along with the required period of inactivity.

## Cold Storage Hook

Creates timelock and transfer restrictions. It restricts execution on the account in two ways: 1) a timelock period and 2) transfers are limited to just one address.

## Hook MultiPlexer

An opinionated router for combining multiple hook modules. Hooks are modules that are triggered before or after execution and can be used to enforce certain smart account behavior. Some examples of hooks include spending limits, white/blacklists, and more. This is an important module for accounts with only one global hook slot.
