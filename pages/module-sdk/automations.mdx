# Automations

Among other things, smart accounts unlock self-custodial account automations. This means that another entity can be allowed to perform certain automations on a users' behalf without needing to take over control of the account. We have built a number of modules that, combined with our [automations service](/automations) unlocks self-custodial automations for applications or wallets.

## Scheduled Transfers

Allows for automated transfers to be triggered on a smart account. The user can create a schedule on which a relayer will execute the transfers based on some parameters, like frequency or number of repetitions.

## Scheduled Orders

Allows for automated token swaps to be triggered on a smart account. The user can create a schedule on which a relayer will execute the swaps based on some parameters, like frequency or number of repetitions.

## Auto Savings

This is a more opinionated version of the Schedule Transfer module. It allows a user to automatically transfer a set percentage of any received token to a target ERC-4626 yield-bearing vault.

## Ownable Executor

Create a hierarchy ownership structure across smart accounts. This module allows one smart account to have execution rights on another smart account. The execution rights can trigger any transaction with the owner account paying for gas. This can enable automated relationships between DAOs and sub-DAOs or main accounts to sub-accounts.
