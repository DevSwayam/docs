# Webauthn Validator

The Webauthn Validator enables a passkey as a signer on a smart account, allowing users to sign cryptographic messages with their biometrics via the secure enclave of their device or use a preferred password manager.

## How it works

The Webauthn Validator is a validator module that verifies signatures made using the secp256r1 curve, which is used in standards like webauthn. This allows users to use passkeys to sign their UserOperations.

## Getting started

To get started with the Webauthn Validator, install it on the smart account of a user and supply the correct owner configuration. When signing a UserOperation, the hash needs to be signed using the owners' passkey.
