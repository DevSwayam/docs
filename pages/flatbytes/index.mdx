# FlatBytes

### **A Library to Store Bytes in Consecutive Storage Slots**

FlatBytes provides an easy way to store bytes in an ERC-4337 compliant way. This is needed because byte strings longer than 32 bytes will be stored in a different storage location to the root slot, breaking ERC-4337 compliance. FlatBytes solves this by storing the bytes in consecutive storage slots.
