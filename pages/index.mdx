# Welcome to Rhinestone

Rhinestone is dedicated to transforming smart accounts into a platform for permissionless innovation. Our mission is to create a secure ecosystem of smart account modules, enabling developers to build powerful on-chain products.

Rhinestone is pioneering a new infrastructure layer that allows any developer to build smart account modules on top of any compatible smart account vendor. Today we support Safe, Biconomy, and ZeroDev.

**Module developers** use Rhinestone to build and distribute their products and services via our integration with these account vendors. **Application developers** access these modules via a module marketplace or self serve through our developer tools.
